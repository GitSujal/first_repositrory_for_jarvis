In August 2014, the core development team has been joined by Jan Holthuis.


    Jan Holthuis <jan.holthuis@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
    Charles Marsh <crmarsh@princeton.edu>
    Shubhro Saha <saha@princeton.edu>

And now it's being modified and renamed as JARVIS by 
    
    Sujal Dhungana <(dhunganasujal9@gmail.com)>
   
    and others who will put their names kater 


We'd also like to thank all the people who reported bugs, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made JARVIS better.

And Now we are going to make major changes on JARVIS to meet our needs.
